# About me
I am an Aerospace Engineer from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, with a Masters degree specialising in Aerodynamics. I am interested in everything about fluid dynamics and tech with roots in sustainability. I am a PhD researcher at Delft University of Technology, working on developing a numerical model that can accurately simulate aerosol transmission from an infected occupant to a susceptible occupant in a social setting. When not working, I watch Formula 1, play video games, work out, and travel.
