# About me
I am an Aerospace Engineer from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, with a Masters degree specialising in Aerodynamics. I am interested in everything fluid dynamics and Tech with roots in sustainability. I am currently a PhD researcher at Delft University of Technology, working on developing a numerical model that can accurately simulate aerosol transmission from an infected occupant to a susceptible occupant in a social setting. I am currently learning to use PALM, which is a Fortran-based open-source parallel large eddy simulation model, that will be used for my PhD. When I am not working, I watch Formula 1 🏎️ on weekends and do some sim racing on Assetto Corsa Competizione 🎮.
